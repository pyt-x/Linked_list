In order to realize the project function in C, a language I am not familiar with, the readability of the code is reduced. I apologize for that.

- ## *Matters needing attention*

This is a Dev-cpp project. The related configuration files are in the config folder.  If you use vs2019 or higher, you may need to make some changes in the code. When you use the executable file for input operation, <u>**do not input randomly**.</u> Entering large numbers is not allowed.

- ### Project function

**<u>*When I heard that the product manager was going to press the keyboard with his face*</u>**, I was so scared that I immediately optimized the input settings. Maybe he wants me to understand that it is possible for users to use my product just like the person below uses a cup. It looks better now, but it's still a little flawed. To view specific functions, please run.(手动狗头）
